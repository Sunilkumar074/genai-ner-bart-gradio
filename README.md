## Development of a Named Entity Recognition (NER) Prototype Using a Fine-Tuned BART Model and Gradio Framework

### AIM:
To design and develop a prototype application for Named Entity Recognition (NER) by leveraging a fine-tuned BART model and deploying the application using the Gradio framework for user interaction and evaluation.

### PROBLEM STATEMENT:
The challenge is to build an NER system capable of identifying named entities (e.g., people, organizations, locations) in text, using a pre-trained BART model fine-tuned for this task. The system should be interactive, allowing users to input text and see the recognized entities in real-time.

### DESIGN STEPS:

#### STEP 1: Fine-tune the BART model
Start by fine-tuning the BART model for NER tasks. This involves training the model on a labeled NER dataset with text data that contains named entities (e.g., people, places, organizations).

#### STEP 2: Create an API for NER model inference
Develop an API endpoint that takes input text and returns the recognized entities using the fine-tuned BART model.

#### STEP 3: Integrate the API with Gradio
Build a Gradio interface that takes user input, passes it to the NER model via the API, and displays the results as highlighted text with identified entities.

### PROGRAM:
```py
import gradio as gr

def summarize(input):
    output = get_completion(input)
    return output[0]['summary_text']

gr.close_all()
demo = gr.Interface(fn=summarize, 
                    inputs=[gr.Textbox(label="Text to summarize", lines=6)],
                    outputs=[gr.Textbox(label="Result", lines=3)],
                    title="Text summarization with distilbart-cnn",
                    description="Summarize any text using the `shleifer/distilbart-cnn-12-6` model under the hood!"
                   )
demo.launch(share=True, server_port=int(os.environ['PORT2']))
```

### RESULT:
Thus, developed an NER prototype application with user interaction and evaluation features, using a fine-tuned BART model deployed through the Gradio framework.
